# NLOP_globalNewton
Nonlinear optimization: Globalized Newton &amp; steepest descent.
This repository contains Matlab code for calculating the minimum for the Rosenbrock function: 
f(x,y) = 100*(y-x^2)^2+(1-x)^2. 
Two algorithms are implemented:
- steepest descent method (steepdesc.m)
- globalized Newton method (globnewton.m)
Other m.-files contain the function, its gradient and Hessian respectively.
