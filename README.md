# Nonlinear Optimization: Globalized Newton and steepest descent
This repository contains Matlab code for calculating the minimum for the Rosenbrock function: 
f(x,y) = 100*(y-x^2)^2+(1-x)^2. 
Two algorithms are implemented:
- steepest descent method (steepdesc.m)
- globalized Newton method (globnewton.m)

## How to start
Execute the respective .m-file in Matlab or Octave.
Other m.-files are auxiliary functions. They contain the Rosenbrock function, its gradient, and Hessian respectively.
